            You may have heard of NFTs before. You may even know that NFT stands for non-fungible token. But you
            might
            not know exactly what that
            means and why this new technology is important for artists, creators, and businesses.<br />Chances are
            you
            first heard about NFTs from
            a news story about an eye-popping purchase price or might have seen it trending on twitter.<br />Before
            we
            get into why NFTs are
            important, beyond their astronomical price tags, let's first start by learning the basics.
        </div>
        <div class="group-1">
            <h1 class="que1">What does non-fungible mean?</h1>
            <div class="ans1">
                A fungible item is one that can be replaced by an identical item. Think of a dollar bill. My $1 bill
                has
                the same purchasing power
                as your $1 bill and any other $1 bill in circulation. In other words, they're mutually
                interchangeable.<br /><br />A non-fungible
                item, on the other hand, is unique and can't be copied or substituted. The Statue of Liberty, the
                Mona
                Lisa, and a ticket for a seat
                at the Super Bowl are all non-fungible items. That is to say, they're one-of-a-kind.
            </div>
            <h1 class="que2">Now , What are NFTs ?</h1>
            <div class="ans2">
                Non-fungible tokens.<br /><br />That doesn't make it any clearer.<br /><br />A non-fungible token
                (NFT)
                is a non-interchangeable
                unit of data stored on a blockchain, a form of digital ledger, that can be sold and traded. Types of
                NFT
                data units may be
                associated with digital files such as photos, videos, and audio. Because each token is uniquely
                identifiable, NFTs differ from most
                cryptocurrencies, such as Bitcoin, which are fungible.<br /><br />NFTs can really be anything
                digital
                (such as drawings, music, your
                brain downloaded and turned into an AI), but a lot of the current excitement is around using the
                tech to
                sell digital art.
            </div>
            <h1 class="que3">What is blockchain ?</h1>
            <div class="ans3">
                A blockchain can most easily be described as a decentralized and distributed server. When you
                interact
                with a blockchain like
                Bitcoin, you're not just sending a transaction to a server farm somewhere as you would in a more
                centralized ecosystem like Amazon,
                for example. Instead, thousands of computers (referred to as miners) will verify portions of your
                transaction simultaneously. This
                makes the blockchain incredibly secure and essentially unhackable.<br /><br />A token is simply a
                crypto
                asset that lives on the
                blockchain. There are many different tokens and many different blockchains.
            </div>
            <h1 class="que4">How do NFTs work?</h1>
            <div class="ans4">
                The most popular blockchain for NFT projects is Ethereum because it was specifically created to
                enable
                developers to build projects
                on top of it. NFTs contain code called a smart contractâ€”a computer program stored on the blockchain
                that
                runs when certain
                conditions are met (more on this later).<br /><br />
                At a very high level, most NFTs are part of the Ethereum blockchain. Ethereum is a cryptocurrency,
                like
                bitcoin or dogecoin, but its
                blockchain also supports these NFTs, which store extra information that makes them work differently
                from, say, an ETH coin. It is
                worth noting that other blockchains can implement their own versions of NFTs.<br /><br />Blockchains
                are
                fairly limited when it
                comes to storage space. This is by design because everything that ever occurs on the blockchain will
                remain there in perpetuity.
                There's a record that represents my ownership of my NFT on the Ethereum blockchain, but the image
                itself
                is not on the blockchain.
                So where is it? Images and other digital assets are typically stored elsewhere. IPFS, the
                Interplanetary
                File System is one of the
                most popular storage solutions because it's also a decentralized protocol.<br /><br />There are some
                on-chain NFTs, meaning they're
                fully stored on the blockchain.
            </div>
            <h1 class="que5">What's the point of NFTs?</h1>
            <div class="ans5">
                I'm an artist.<br /><br />You might be interested in NFTs because it gives you a way to sell work
                that
                there otherwise might not be
                much of a market for.&nbsp;&nbsp;NFTs have a feature that you can enable that will pay you a
                percentage
                every time the NFT is sold
                or changes hands, making sure that if your work gets super popular and balloons in value, you'll see
                some of that benefit.<br /><br />I'm
                a buyer.<br /><br />One of the obvious benefits of buying art is it lets you financially support
                artists
                you like, and that's true
                with NFTs. Buying an NFT also usually gets you some basic usage rights, like being able to post the
                image online or set it as your
                profile picture. Plus, of course, there are bragging rights that you own the art, with a blockchain
                entry to back it up.<br /><br />No,
                I meant I'm a collector.<br /><br />Ah, okay, yes. NFTs can work like any other speculative asset,
                where
                you buy it and hope that
                the value of it goes up one day, so you can sell it for a profit. I feel kind of dirty for talking
                about
                that, though.
            </div>
            <h1 class="que6">The future of NFTs</h1>
            <div class="ans6">
                Like any new technology, it's impossible to predict all the ways developers, creators, and
                businesses
                will utilize NFTs and their
                innovative underlying smart contracts.<br /><br />We will almost certainly see NFTs used for
                tracking
                ownership of things like real
                estate, college degrees, professional licenses, event tickets, and countless other contracts that
                currently live on pieces of paper.
                All of those will take time to come to fruition. And in some cases, most people might not even know
                NFT
                technology is being used for
                them.<br /><br />Ultimately, the limit to what is possible with NFTs is up to our imagination.
